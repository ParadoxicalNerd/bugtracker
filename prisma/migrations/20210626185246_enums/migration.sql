  - You are about to drop the column `ofType` on the `Ticket` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `ofType` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `type` to the `Ticket` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `status` on the `Ticket` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `priority` on the `Ticket` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Added the required column `type` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
